# socket-io-refactor
In this phase, weâ€™ll be moving away from using Node Events for managing a pool of events, instead refactoring to using the Socket.io libraries. This allows communication between Server and Client applications.  The intent here is to build the data services that would drive a suite of applications where we can see pickups and deliveries in real-time.
